# CSE306 Ray Tracer Project

Author : Alexandre Bismuth

The full report for this project can be found in raytracer_report.pdf

## Project Overview

This project implements a handcrafted ray tracer. It includes the following elements:

- Diffuse and mirror surfaces
- Transparent surfaces (optional)
- Direct lighting and shadows
- Indirect lighting without Russian roulette
- Antialiasing
- Depth of field (optional)
- Ray mesh intersection including BVH
- Interpolation (optional)
- Textures (optional)

The only missing element is area light source. Multiple pictures relating to implemented features can be found in the ```output``` directory.

This repository also includes the code for the ungraded diffusion lab in ```diffusion.ipynb```. My code for this lab is based on the formulas from section 3.2 of the lecture notes, the code given on Moodle, and the 30/04/25 tutorial session.

## Bibliography

The code for this project is based on the textbook for *CSE306 - Computer Graphics* by Nicolas Bonneel and on the pastebins that were handed out to students for this project.
